            <p>Meet Adiam, a dedicated wanna-be software developer, I like to think of myself as a dedicated software developer and 
                enthusiast for continuous learning. Despite the inevitable challenges that come with the journey, I embrace the philosophy of 
                "wax on and wax out" or simply "breathe in and out". Always try to find joy in the pursuit of knowledge and growth. 
                This disciplined yet adaptable approach not only characterizes my coding endeavors but also extends to my love for Pilates as well as learning new languages.
                In this jounery of living life I learned three valuable traits to have is empathy, resilience & adaptablity.Two is always to do what makes you happy & as for one peice of advice, "don't take things personally".
